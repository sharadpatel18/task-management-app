# Task Management App

## Overview
Welcome to the Task Management App repository! This application is designed to create and manage tasks for employees, with functionality for login, task progress tracking, and role-based access control. Built using React, this app currently stores data in localStorage as it serves as a frontend learning project. Backend integration is planned for future updates.

## Features
### Implemented
- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality.
- **Task Creation**: Create tasks for employees, assign tasks, and manage task status.
- **Task Progress Tracking**: Tasks progress through five stages: Create, Working, Bug, Error, Completed.
- **Sub-task Management**: Add sub-tasks to main tasks, track errors, and update task status automatically.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Only Managers, Developers, Designers, and Testers can access their specific tasks.
- **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in localStorage.

### Future Enhancements
- **Backend Integration**: Use a backend service for data persistence and retrieval.
- **Enhanced Task Features**: Additional task attributes and filtering options.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Design enhancements for better user experience.
